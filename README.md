# VP_Tree Exercise
Parallel &amp; Distributed Computer Systems Exercise 1

### File explanation:
- VP_Tree.cpp, vptree.h, vptree.cpp, pch.h, pch.cpp are VS temporary files
- vptree/inc header file vptree.h
- vptree/lib compiled libraries vpree_(TYPES).a. (Use Makefile to compile them to your machine)
- vptree/matlab matlab scripts to evaluate the correctness of created tree
- vptree/src source files vptree_(TYPES).c with the functions to create tree and main.c to generate random points, timer the application and export data for matlab evaluation
- vptree/tester contains elearning files, slightly modifided, to evaluate libraries
- vptree/Makefile to compile libraries into vptree/lib folder and main_(TYPES)
